### Optimization Analysis of Operational Process(Aurubis Buffalo)
### Operational Analysis - Descriptive Analysis and Predictive Analysis (Analytical Tool: Python and Tableau)

> Aurubis is a manufacturing operation producing copper and brass strip for use in diverse industries. Aurubis currently has several initiatives to expand their data analytics systems and focused on bringing data together across different business system platform. They collects data from all of its processes, both manufacturing and administrative. Data is stored on several platform throughout the organization including Oracle, SQL Server and DB2.

> The purpose of this project is to create operational optimization strategy for yield improvement and increasing the accuracy of standard yield. I conducted descriptive analysis through Tableau to create dynamic dashboard for describing yield pattern of each product type in each coil level. We also ran preditive machine learning model using Lasso, Ridge, XGboost, Random Forest to optimize the accuracy of prediction. Based on our analysis, we found out the main dirvers for yield production and give solid recommendation to the clients. Clients are very satisified with our work, and we won the first place out of six teams in total.

> EarlyRiders is a toy company specializing in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials.The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. They realized that their product set was underperforming. 

> They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users.For this purpose, we are going to create a conjoint analysis and market recommedination to decide whether the product line should change and which products launch next.

### Business Intelligence in Pricing Analysis - Iron Mountian(Information Management)
### Pricing Strategy  - (Analytical Tool: Pricefx software, Python, R)


**[Download Final Presentation on Github](https://github.com/Jiangcheng-Lin/Jiangcheng-Lin.github.io/blob/master/Pricing%20Project/Iron%20Mountain%20Pricing%20Analytics.pdf)**

> As a pricing analyst(practicum), I had participated in Iron Mountain Pricing Case Competition with Fangyuan(Milar) Liu, Kaili Tan, Yuheng Xiong, Yuqiao(Echo) Zhong as a team to give pricing strategy recommendation to the management team from Iron Mountain. Finally, we won the first place out of 6 final teams.

> From this case competition, we were able to use data visualization in Pricefx, Python, and R using pricing analytics such as elasticity, customer segmentation, and price sensitivity analysis. We found out the different variation change by location and client size and analyzed the further impact of post-acquisition. Finally, we extracted business insights to create a profitable pricing strategy for the client.

### Credit Risk Evaluation Model from Decision Support System
### Predictive Model and Interactive Interface (Analytical Tool: Python)


**[Download Final Presentation on Github](https://github.com/Jiangcheng-Lin/Jiangcheng-Lin.github.io/blob/master/Predictive%20Analysis%20Project/Decision%20Support%20System.pdf)**

> Every year, credit scoring methodologies provide millions of scores that evaluate the risk in billions of dollars in loans; in fact, the FICO Score is used in more than 90% of lending decisions in the US. Credit scores are an important factor that financial institutions consider when deciding whether or not to approve a loan.

> In this academic project, in order to predict the applicant evaluation for Home Equity Line of Credit(HELOC). We need to develop a predictive model and decision support system interface to justify the accurancy of prediction.
